# Cocktail Website 🍸

A modern, animated cocktail website built to explore advanced frontend animations using **GSAP**.

## About the Project

This project is my first hands-on experience with **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**. While building it, I gained a deeper understanding of how animations can enhance user experience and how powerful GSAP is for creating smooth, timeline-based interactions.

The project helped me realize that frontend development goes far beyond layouts and styling—animation, motion, and interaction design play a huge role.

## What I Learned

- GSAP timelines and sequencing
- Scroll-based animations
- Better control over UI motion
- Thinking about animation as part of UX, not decoration

## Tech Stack

- React
- Tailwind
- React-responsive
- GSAP

## Credits

This project was built with guidance and learning material from the **JavaScript Mastery** YouTube GSAP course. Some parts are inspired by their tutorials and structure.
